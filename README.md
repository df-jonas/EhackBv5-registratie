```

DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=ehackb
DB_USERNAME=ehackb

```

After this step, you should migrate the database from the migration files:
```
php artisan migrate
```

When there steps are done, you should be able to navigatie to your [localhost](http://localhost).

If you wish to seed the database with test values, you can enter one additional command:
